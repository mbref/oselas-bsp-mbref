-	  In Xilinx FPGAs, the hardware can change quite dramatically while
-	  still running the same kernel.  In this case and other similar
-	  ones, it is preferable to associate the device tree with a
-	  particular build of the hardware design.  This configuration
-	  option assumes that the device tree blob has been compressed and
-	  stored in Block RAM in the FPGA design.  Typically, such a block
-	  ram is available in order to provide a bootloop or other code
-	  close to the reset vector at the top of the address space.  By
-	  default, the parameter options associated with this configuration
-	  assumes that exactly one block ram (2KB) of storage is available,
-	  which should be sufficient for most designs.  If necessary in a
-	  particular design, due to boot code requirement or a large number
-	  of devices, this address (and the corresponding parameters in the
-	  EDK design) must be modified.
-
-	  Note that in some highly area constrained designs, no block rams
-	  may be available in the design, and some other mechanism may be
-	  used to hold the processor in reset while external memory is
-	  initialized with processor code.  In such cases, that mechanism
-	  should also be used to load the device tree at an appropriate
-	  location, and the parameters associated with this configuration
-	  option should be modified to point to that location in external
-	  memory.
