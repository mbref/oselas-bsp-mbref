-*
-* This driver supports the following features:
-*
-* - Polled mode
-* - Interrupt driven mode
-*
-* <b>Interrupts</b>
-*
-* The device does not have any way to disable the receiver such that the
-* receiver may contain unwanted data. The IP is reset driver is initialized,
-*
-* The driver defaults to no interrupts at initialization such that interrupts
-* must be enabled if desired. An interrupt is generated for any of the following
-* conditions.
-*
-* - Data in the receiver
-* - Any receive status error detected
-* - Data byte transmitted
-* - Any transmit status error detected
-*
-* The application can control which interrupts are enabled using the SetOptions
-* function.
-*
-* In order to use interrupts, it is necessary for the user to connect the
-* driver interrupt handler, XPs2_InterruptHandler(), to the interrupt system of
-* the application. This function does not save and restore the processor
-* context such that the user must provide it. A handler must be set for the
-* driver such that the handler is called when interrupt events occur. The
-* handler is called from interrupt context and is designed to allow application
-*  specific processing to be performed.
-*
-* The functions, XPs2_Send() and Ps2_Recv(), are provided in the driver to
-* allow data to be sent and received. They are designed to be used in polled
-* or interrupt modes.
-*
-* <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
-*
-* The XPs2_Config structure is used by the driver to configure itself. This
-* configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based on HW
-* build properties.
-*
-* To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed
-* by various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized in one
-* of the following ways:
-*
-*   - XPs2_Initialize(InstancePtr, DeviceId) - The driver looks up its own
-*     configuration structure created by the tool-chain based on an ID provided
-*     by the tool-chain.
-*
-*   - XPs2_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, EffectiveAddr) - Uses a
-*     configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a system
-*     with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address
-*     replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.

-* 1.00a ch   06/18/02 First release
-* 1.01a jvb  12/14/05 I separated dependency on the static config table and

-*                     _Initialize and _LookupConfig to _sinit.c. I also added
